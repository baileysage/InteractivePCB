# How to Contribute to InteractivePCB

Hello! We're glad you're reading this because InteractivePCB always welcomes new features, bug reports, working on documentation, and more! We are a small team, so do be patient with us as we may not be able to respond to contributions immediately.

- Adding new or updating example boards
- Working on documentation

## Claiming An Issue

If you wish to claim a GitHub issue, please review the full issue as we try to make them as detailed as possible. If you wish to claim it, leave a comment indicating so.

Read below about our Issue to PR process.

## Reporting Bugs or Issues

Did you find a bug? Great! Make sure it's not already reported on our [Issues Page](https://github.com/oceanofthelost/InteractivePCB/issues) page. If it's not, please open up a [New Issue](https://github.com/oceanofthelost/InteractivePCB/issues/new/choose) and add it so we can look it over.

Please make your issue as detailed as possible! Add in the page or URL it happened at, what you were doing when the error occurred, or any other details important to the issue. We may contact you to try to get more details if we can't replicate it.

## From Issue to PR

Think you can tackle an issue? Great!

1. First, fork the repo so you have your own copy of it
1. Create a new branch. You can name it whatever you want, but We'd recommend something descriptive, like `issue-1234-fix-string-exception`
1. Make your changes! We suggest committing early and often.
1. Make sure you test the changes. Check out how to run the project on the [`README.md`](https://github.com/oceanofthelost/InteractivePCB/blob/main/README.md) page.
1. If you can test the changes and they work reliably, then create a new pull request. Be sure to either add `Fixes #1234` or `Closes #1234` so GitHub can link your issue number automatically.
1. We'll review it and leave any comments for things that may need to change. Changes aren't requested because your code is bad but as a consideration towards how it may work with other parts of the project or ways the user might interact with it.
1. Finally, we'll merge it in!

## Adding New Features

If you strongly believe there should be a new feature or something is really lacking in the tool, you are welcome to add an [Issue](https://github.com/oceanofthelost/InteractivePCB/issues/new/choose) and we'll consider it.

## Adding or Revising Documentation

We want InteractivePCB to be easy-to-use for anyone with enough interest in working better with PCBs to wind up here. That requires good documentation of many facets of the project. We will very much welcome any additional changes or suggestions on what to change or how to evolve the documentation so it's helpful for people to understand the technical side of the tool.
